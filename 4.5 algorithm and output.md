4.5 Stone Inventory Management


Scenario: You are managing a stone inventory stored in a dictionary where key = item name, value = (price, quantity). Write a program to display items that are out of stock and total value of available stock.

Algorithm:

1. Create the inventory dictionary with item names as keys and tuples (price, quantity) as values.

2. Initialize total_value to 0.

3. Loop over each item in inventory: extract price and quantity.

4. If quantity == 0, print it as out of stock.

5. Else, add (price * quantity) to total_value.

6. After loop, print the total value of available stock.

Code:
inventory = {
    "Apples": (50, 20),
    "Bananas": (10, 0),
    "Oranges": (30, 15),
    "Grapes": (40, 0),
    "Mangoes": (60, 12)
}
total_value = 0
print("Out of stock items:")
for item, (price, quantity) in inventory.items():
    if quantity == 0:
        print(f"- {item}")
    else:
        total_value += price * quantity
print(f"Total value of available stock: ${total_value}")

Output:
Out of stock items:
Bananas
Grapes
Total value of available stock: $2170
