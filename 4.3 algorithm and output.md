4.3 Unique Items Sold Over 3 Days

Scenario: A shop sells items, and each day's sales are stored in a list. Find the unique items sold over 3 days.

Algorithm:

1. Support three lists representing items sold on day 1, 2, and 3 (duplicates allowed).

2. Combine all items from the three lists into a single list.

3. Convert the combined list into a set to get unique elements.

4. Display the unique items.

Code:
day_1 = ["apple", "banana", "orange", "apple"]
day_2 = ["banana", "Kiwi", "grape"]
day_3 = ["orange", "grape", "melon", "apple"]
all_items = day_1 + day_2 + day_3
unique_items = set(all_items)
print("Unique items sold over 3 days:")
for item in unique_items:
    print(item)

Output:
Unique items sold over 3 days:
banana
Kiwi
grape
orange
apple
melon
