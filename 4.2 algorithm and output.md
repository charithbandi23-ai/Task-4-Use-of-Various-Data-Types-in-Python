4.2 Employees from IT Department


Scenario: A company stores employee data as tuples (id, name, department). Write a program to display all employees from the "IT" department.

Algorithm:

1. Create a list to store employee records as tuples.

2. Input number of employees.

3. Input ID, name, and department for each employee. Append tuple to the list.

4. Iterate through the list and display employees from IT department.

Code:
employees = [
    (101, 'Alice', 'HR'),
    (102, 'Bob', 'IT'),
    (103, 'Charlie', 'Finance'),
    (104, 'David', 'IT'),
    (105, 'Eva', 'Marketing')
]
print("Employees from IT Department:")
for emp in employees:
    emp_id, name, department = emp
    if department == 'IT':
        print(f"ID: {emp_id}, Name: {name}, Department: {department}")

Output:
Employees from IT Department:
ID: 102, Name: Bob, Department: IT
ID: 104, Name: David, Department: IT
